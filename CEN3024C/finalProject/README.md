# Final Project
July 2023

## Objective
Compile all word occurences assignments into one complete project.

## Sections
* Source control
* Documentation/JavaDoc
* Creating a UI
* Unit Testing
* Databases
* Deployment

### Source Control
In order to implement source control I used github. The Final Project file on github doesn't have as many commits because I added the files from the modules. The history of the source control is listed within each respective module for each lesson.

### Documentation/JavaDoc
My documentation for methods was created with JavaDoc. To fully implement JavaDoc I wrote a JavaDoc comment for every method in my `word parser` and my `main` .java files.

### Creating a UI
To create the UI I used `JavaFX`. I created a simple UI that can allow the user to view the full poem and generate a list of the 20 most frequent words in the poem. Both windows have a back button to allow for travel between the windows without restarting the program.

### Unit Testing

### Databases

### Deployment
