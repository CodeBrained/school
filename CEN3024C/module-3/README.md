# Module 3 - Defining Requirements

May 2023

## Objective 
Create a use case diagram for a class registration system. The system expects the user to enter the list of courses he or she wants to register for. The system must check that all prerequisites have been met. At the end, the system will display the final course schedule for the student.

This is a little open-ended. You don't need to make it very elaborate, but I would like at least detailed one-use case diagram and two requirement specifications. Look at examples on the Web for inspiration but turn in your own take on the problem.
