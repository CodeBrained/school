# Module 11 - Deployment

July 2023

## Objectives

* Write a client/server application with two parts, a server and a client. Have the client send the server a request to compute whether a number that the user provided is prime. The server responds with yes or no, then the client displays the answer.
* Simulate deploying the above application to a user's computer. If you're really ambitious and want to show off, after you get the simple one working, add client/server functionality to your Word Occurrences application.
* Generate a runnable Jar file using IntelliJ (recommended) or Eclipse.
* In a command window, run the jar file using the syntax "java -jar <name>.jar"
